Using 20 observations, I produce the plot using the R API of `plotly`.  Cool thing about rendering a scatterplot using `plotly` is that it is interactive.  It appears that there are 3 or 4 groups depending on how to "slice" it.  I can see a group of the older individuals, all grandparents.  I can see one of the short/lower-weight individuals (all children) as well.  Centroids could be 

$$Centroid_1 = (age = 10,~ weight = 57,~ height = 53)$$
$$Centroid_2 = (age = 30,~ weight = 150,~ height = 69)$$
$$Centroid_3 = (age = 66,~ weight = 180,~ height = 67)$$


```{r, eval=F}
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(df, x = ~age, y = ~weight, z = ~height) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Age'),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'Weight'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Height')))

p
```

If we choose $k = 3$ using k-means clustering and then coloring the points by group we can see how well we do.  

```{r, eval=F}
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(df, x = ~age, y = ~weight, z = ~height, color = ~group) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Age'),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'Weight'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Height')))

p

Not too bad, if we orient it right we can see the distinct groups better.  *Kmeans* includes the taller/heavier oldest individual in the tall/heavier group where I would have grouped that individual in the "grandparents" group.  But other than that it doesn't look too bad.  For reference I show the kmeans centroids.  

```{r}
knitr::kable(km$centers)
```


What if we sliced it using 3 groups and hiearchal clustering with single linkage, still using $k = 3$ as the number of clusters. 

```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(df[-4]), method = "single")
mb <- cutree(hc, k = 5)
df$cluster <- factor(mb)
```


```{r, eval=F}
p <- plot_ly(df, x = ~age, y = ~weight, z = ~height, color = ~cluster) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Age'),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'Weight'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Height')))

p
```


Groups are different, I'd even argue they are "
better".
