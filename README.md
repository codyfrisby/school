# School Work Directory
Place to keep all my code and notes from my school work (BS in Statistics) at UVU. Originally I started out creating a directory for each course I took as I created documents and code that I wanted to keep.  As I progressed through it that directory list grew too large.  I decided to place it all in this directory with sub directories named for each course.
